# 2048-iOS

2048 for iOS is an open source multiplayer version of 2048 game for iOS.  

Multiplayer version of 2048 places players on a 1 on 1 matchup against their friends or other players from around the world. The game is played on a single board shared between both the players who take turns to play. The score of a player is computed by the number on the tiles that the player merges when playing his turn. The game ends when there are no moves remaining or someone reaches the 2048 tile. At this point, the player with the highest score wins the game.
